```

Before starting a Julia session, please set the following environment variable:
```export GSPC_APPLICATION_SEARCH_PATH=$HOME/.distributedworkflow/workflows```

Next, when testing the application locally set the hostname as follows:
```hostname > <path-to-a-nodefile>```

Start a Julia session and load the package with ```using DistributedWorkflow``` and initiate the connection by using the following function:
```initiate_connection()```

Assuming that you have a workflow Petri net stored in an accessible location, use ```compile_workflow(<workflow-name>.xpnet, "/path/to/build/location")``` function to compile the workflow.

Next, start the client using ```client(<number-of-workers>, "/path/to/nodefile", "rif-strategy")```

As a next step, it is advisible to create a script with your workflow configuration (see the executor files in the examples folder), and submit your application using the ```submit_workflow()``` function.

Once your application runs through, the output files will be stored in your desired output location.

## A simple example
* A small example to create a Petri net, compile it, start agent and run the application locally.

# API Functions
* A list of all the api functions plus the description in a table.
<!-- insert table of methods available to the user with a short description of what they do -->

# Features
* Serializer agnostic, for details see (add the file in the docs that explains the serialiser part).
* Reduced complexity in deploying your parallel application.
* Localised testing of workflow, before launching expensive cluster resources.
* Write your own `xpnet` file and compile your workflow using the `compile_workflow()` function. 
* You could also, generate a Petri net in Julia using `PetriNet()` and generate the `xpnet` file from the Petri net using `workflow_generator()` before compiling it.
* Visualise Petri net within the Julia REPL.

# Shortcomings
* At the moment, this package is only efficient and recommended for long running processes.
* Due to the limitations of the underlying workflow manager, this package is limited to the following operating systems:
```
* Centos 7
* Oracle Linux 8
* Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
```

* [More Examples]( ./examples)
* [XPNET Format Schema](https://github.com/cc-hpc-itwm/gpispace/blob/v23.06/share/xml/xsd/pnet.xsd)
* [GPI-Space database on Petri nets](https://github.com/cc-hpc-itwm/gpispace/tree/v23.06/share/doc/example)

# ToDo...
* Add examples for a cluster run.
* Improve UI by adding documentation and examples.
* Extend the interface to add more features.


# Appendix
The underlying workflow management system is called [GPI-Space](https://www.gpi-space.de/) which is a a task-based workflow management system for parallel applications developed at Fraunhofer ITWM by the CC-HPC group.
